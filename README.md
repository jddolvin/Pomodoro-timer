and the application will automatically spin up a server and open it in your default browser.

## How to use the application
This application helps one utilize the "pomodoro technique" for studying, debugging, research, or any other similar use you can imagine. 
It is meant to break up such tasks into manageable bite-size pieces to keep one from becoming 'burnt out' on a topic.
You may adjust the values as desired, but I recommend keeping the defaults, as they have been proven to work best.
